    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Reviewing Each Constraint**:\n",
    "   - We test the feasibility and cost implications of each constraint:\n",
    "     - Regional restriction for processing plants (part c).\n",
    "     - High-quality raw material sourcing (part d).\n",
    "     - Processing risk mitigation (3% cap on material processed at any plant, part e).\n",
    "     - Supply risk mitigation (50% cap on fertilizer supply from any plant to a single home center, part e).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining Financial Defensibility**:\n",
    "   - A constraint is considered financially defensible if:\n",
    "     - It results in a feasible solution.\n",
    "     - The cost increase is minimal or justified by operational benefits (e.g., risk reduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Defensible Options**:\n",
    "   - After identifying defensible constraints, we solve a combined optimization problem with all defensible constraints implemented together.\n",
    "   - This will give us the final **optimal cost** while meeting all operational requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Outcome:\n",
    "- Evaluate the cost of each constraint separately to identify defensible options.\n",
    "- Determine the final optimal cost when all defensible options are combined.\n",
    "- Provide a clear explanation of why the chosen constraints are defensible.\n"

    "#### Context:\n",
    "In part (f), multiple defensible constraints were identified based on feasibility and cost implications. While implementing all defensible options together results in an **optimal cost of $5,744,544.11**, representing a **150.03% increase over the base cost**, the strategic benefits far outweigh the financial impact. This section provides a granular breakdown of the costs, their implications, and the justification for implementing all defensible options.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost Breakdown by Constraint:\n",
    "1. **Regional Restriction (Part c)**:\n",
    "   - **Cost Increase**: **1.62%**.\n",
    "   - **Details**: This constraint restricts processing plants to supply home centers within their geographic regions.\n",
    "   - **Justification**:\n",
    "     - The cost increase is negligible, making this a highly cost-effective improvement to the supply chain.\n",
    "     - It aligns supply chains geographically, ensuring that transportation flows are streamlined and predictable.\n",
    "     - **Risk Balancing**: By ensuring that regions are self-reliant, this constraint minimizes the operational risk of regional disruptions. For example, if a region experiences transportation or facility delays, the impact is contained within that region without affecting others. \n",
    "     - This balancing act improves the overall resilience of the supply chain by spreading risk evenly across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High-Quality Raw Material (Part d)**:\n",
    "   - **Cost Increase**: **148.69%**.\n",
    "   - **Details**: Only high-quality raw materials (levels 3 and 4) are sourced from farms to ensure superior product quality.\n",
    "   - **Justification**:\n",
    "     - Although this constraint incurs the highest cost increase, it guarantees product reliability, which is critical for maintaining long-term customer trust and satisfaction.\n",
    "     - Superior product quality enhances brand equity and can command higher prices in competitive markets, offsetting the increased cost over time.\n",
    "     - This constraint is particularly important for industries where reputation and reliability directly drive sales and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **3% Processing Risk Mitigation (Part e)**:\n",
    "   - **Cost Increase**: **0.87%**.\n",
    "   - **Details**: Each processing plant is limited to handling no more than 3% of the total raw material sourced from farms.\n",
    "   - **Justification**:\n",
    "     - This constraint significantly reduces the risk of over-reliance on individual facilities. If one plant experiences downtime, its absence will not critically disrupt operations.\n",
    "     - The cost increase is minimal, making it a highly defensible investment in supply chain risk mitigation.\n",
    "     - By diversifying processing loads across facilities, this constraint creates redundancy in the network, which is essential for long-term resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **50% Supply Risk Mitigation (Part e)**:\n",
    "   - **Cost Increase**: **0.54%**.\n",
    "   - **Details**: Each processing plant is limited to supplying no more than 50% of fertilizer to any single home center.\n",
    "   - **Justification**:\n",
    "     - This constraint prevents home centers from over-relying on a single processing facility, reducing the risk of supply disruptions caused by bottlenecks or facility downtime.\n",
    "     - The negligible cost increase (less than 1%) makes this a straightforward, cost-effective improvement to the supply chain.\n",
    "     - Balanced supply distribution across facilities also ensures operational fairness and avoids systemic risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Combined Defensible Options**:\n",
    "   - **Cost Increase**: **150.03%**.\n",
    "   - **Details**: The combined implementation of all defensible constraints incurs the highest overall cost but addresses multiple critical supply chain risks and operational priorities.\n",
    "   - **Justification**:\n",
    "     - Combining the constraints ensures that the supply chain operates with a strong focus on risk mitigation, quality assurance, and balanced regional operations.\n",
    "     - The integrated solution is an investment in the company’s long-term stability, protecting against potential disruptions and enhancing overall supply chain reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Justifications for Implementing All Defensible Options:\n",
    "1. **Risk Mitigation**:\n",
    "   - The **3% processing constraint** and **50% supply constraint** safeguard the supply chain from over-reliance on any single facility or region.\n",
    "   - These measures create a robust supply chain that can withstand disruptions, ensuring continuity of operations even during unforeseen events.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quality Assurance**:\n",
    "   - The **high-quality constraint** ensures that only the best raw materials are used for production, which directly enhances product reliability.\n",
    "   - This focus on quality strengthens the company’s reputation and competitive advantage, especially in markets where customer trust and product performance are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operational Resilience**:\n",
    "   - The **regional restriction** ensures balanced supply chain operations across regions, reducing the impact of localized disruptions and making logistics more predictable.\n",
    "   - By evenly distributing risk and maintaining redundancy across the network, the company ensures stability and resilience against external shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Strategic Scalability**:\n",
    "   - These constraints position the company for future scalability by building a supply chain framework that is both resilient and adaptable.\n",
    "   - While the cost increase is significant, it reflects a long-term investment in risk reduction and operational excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "Although implementing all defensible options leads to a substantial cost increase, the strategic benefits far outweigh the financial impact. These include:\n",
    "- Reduced vulnerability to supply chain disruptions through risk mitigation and redundancy.\n",
    "- Improved product reliability and customer satisfaction through strict quality control.\n",
    "- A balanced and resilient supply chain capable of adapting to future challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting these defensible options, the company demonstrates its commitment to long-term stability, operational excellence, and customer trust, positioning itself as a leader in supply chain management."

    "### Purpose:\n",
    "The purpose of this test is to iteratively decrease the sourcing limit constraint, starting at 3.0% and reducing it in steps of 0.1%, to identify the threshold at which the model becomes infeasible. This analysis provides insights into the supply chain network's capacity for risk mitigation and identifies the minimum sustainable sourcing limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "1. The model remains feasible for sourcing limits of 3.0% down to 2.5%. Each reduction increases the total transportation and procurement cost slightly due to the tighter sourcing restrictions.\n",
    "2. At a sourcing limit of 2.4%, the model becomes infeasible, indicating that the supply chain cannot sustain operations under such a stringent constraint.\n",
    "3. The last feasible sourcing limit is confirmed to be **2.5%**, highlighting the network's lower bound for sourcing risk mitigation without violating constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managerial Interpretation:\n",
    "- The results underscore the delicate balance between cost optimization and risk mitigation in supply chain management.\n",
    "- While sourcing limits below 3.0% lead to incremental cost increases, the system reaches a critical point of infeasibility at 2.4%, demonstrating the network's finite capacity for handling sourcing risk.\n",
    "- Management must carefully evaluate trade-offs: pushing for tighter sourcing constraints (e.g., below 2.5%) might undermine operational feasibility and require redesigning the network or relaxing other constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications:\n",
    "1. **Operational Viability**: The network design can accommodate a sourcing limit as low as 2.5%, providing a clear benchmark for policy decisions.\n",
    "2. **Risk Mitigation Strategy**: A feasible sourcing limit ensures sufficient material allocation across plants while managing transportation costs within acceptable bounds.\n",
    "3. **Cost vs. Feasibility Trade-offs**: While tighter constraints can theoretically mitigate risk, they may lead to infeasibility, highlighting the importance of a balanced approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The test demonstrates that the optimal balance for the current network is achieved with a sourcing limit of 2.5%, ensuring both cost-effectiveness and operational feasibility. This insight enables data-driven decision-making for managing supply chain risks effectively."

    "### Reasoning for Proportional Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset analysis highlights several key aspects of using proportional allocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diversity in Exercise Metrics:**\n",
    "   - **Hypertrophy Rating Range:** The hypertrophy ratings range from 0.256 to 1.0, showcasing a significant variation in muscle-building potential across exercises. This supports the need for flexibility in choosing exercises based on goals.\n",
    "   - **Stimulus-to-Fatigue Ratio Range:** With a range of 0.241 to 0.959, there is a broad spectrum of exercises in terms of efficiency and recovery needs.\n",
    "   - **Expected Time Range:** The expected times range from 10.40 to 25.82 minutes, allowing for tailored allocation of exercises based on available workout duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diverse Options:**\n",
    "   - **Unique Categories:** The dataset includes 4 categories of exercises, providing opportunities to target different fitness goals, such as strength, endurance, or hypertrophy.\n",
    "   - **Unique Body Parts:** The 17 unique body parts emphasize the richness of the dataset and the ability to create balanced and comprehensive workout plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility and Optimization:**\n",
    "   - Proportional allocation enables dynamic adjustments, making it possible to select and emphasize exercises based on individual priorities, such as hypertrophy or recovery. This approach allows for customization while avoiding the rigidity of pre-selecting exact exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "1. Proportional allocation is more practical because it leverages the diversity in exercise metrics (e.g., hypertrophy rating, stimulus-to-fatigue ratio, expected time) to optimize workout programs tailored to individual needs.\n",
    "2. The flexibility of this approach ensures that workouts can dynamically adapt to specific fitness goals, time constraints, and recovery requirements, making it more versatile than specifying exact exercises for every session."

    "### Analysis of Results for Question 1(d)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Optimization:\n",
    "- **Original Optimal Hypertrophy Rating:** `0.6015`\n",
    "- **Relaxed Optimal Hypertrophy Rating:** `0.6033`\n",
    "- **Improvement in Hypertrophy Rating:** `0.0018`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shadow Price and Sensitivity Analysis:\n",
    "- The **shadow price** of the SFR constraint (`Constraint 5`) is `1.8291`.\n",
    "- This shadow price represents the expected improvement in the objective value (hypertrophy rating) per unit relaxation in the constraint. \n",
    "- For a relaxation of `0.001`, the predicted improvement in the hypertrophy rating is calculated as:Predicted Improvement = Shadow Price * Relaxation Amount = 1.8291 * 0.001 = 0.0018\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison of Predicted and Observed Improvement:\n",
    "- **Predicted Improvement:** `0.0018`\n",
    "- **Observed Improvement:** `0.0018`\n",
    "- Since the predicted improvement matches the observed improvement, the sensitivity analysis estimate is **valid**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "- Relaxing the SFR constraint by `0.001` results in a hypertrophy rating increase of `0.0018`, which is consistent with the shadow price-based prediction.\n",
    "- This indicates that the estimate is valid and that no basis change occurred during the relaxation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insights:\n",
    "- Sensitivity analysis and shadow prices are powerful tools to predict the impact of minor changes in constraints. They save computational effort and provide insights into the model's behavior without re-optimization.\n",
    "- However, for larger changes in constraints, the validity of such estimates may reduce due to potential basis changes in the optimization model."
