    "2. The city of Los Angeles recently enacted a new hotel worker protection ordinance, impacting workload limits for hotel attendants in the region. Based on this ordinance, the Beverly Hills Four Seasons is updating its scheduling process to avoid incurring penalties. The new regulations stipulate that:\n",
    "- All attendants receive a full 8 hours pay even if they work less then this. They are also allowed to work a maximum of 2 hours of overtime (in hourly increments) at 1.5 times their hourly wage.\n",
    "- An attendant may clean between 2 and 4 floors per day. Attendants who clean more than two rooms (i.e., three of four) receive an additional $75 per floor.\n",
    "- Each attendant can clean 3500 square feet of rooms per day. If they exceed this value, they double their regular hourly wage (this does not include overtime hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data on rooms, including square footage, floor location, and the cleaning time (hours), has been provided in the file hotels.csv. Suppose there are 8 attendants working today, each earning an hourly wage of $25. Formulate and solve a binary program to minimize the hotel’s staffing cost while ensuring all rooms are cleaned and the new ordinance requirements are accounted for.\n"
