    "The LP relaxation results in a **lower optimal cost** ($1,660.51 vs $1,750.00) because it allows fractional room assignments, which distribute workloads more efficiently. The **reduction in total overtime hours** from 4 to 3.24 suggests that forcing integer constraints in the binary program leads to inefficiencies and increased costs. However, since floor violations remain at **zero** in both cases, this constraint is strictly maintained regardless of relaxation.\n",

    "This finding highlights that while the relaxed solution serves as a **useful lower bound**, it is not directly implementable due to its fractional assignments. The need for integer constraints in real-world scheduling problems leads to **higher costs but ensures feasible workforce allocation**, as demonstrated by the significant computational improvement (solving time reduced from 3.98 to 0.04 seconds with no branch-and-bound nodes needed)."

    "### Answer to Question I: Impact of Doubling Overtime Pay\n",
    "\n",
    "With the overtime multiplier increased to **2×** instead of **1.5×**, the **optimal cost increased** from $1750.00 (Question E) to $1775.00. However, **total overtime hours decreased from 4 to 2**, suggesting that the model reduced reliance on overtime due to its higher cost. Additionally, **one floor violation occurred**, whereas there were **zero floor violations in Question E**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison to Question (D)\n",
    "In Question (D), we predicted that:\n",
    "1. With **1.5× overtime pay**, the model would prefer using **overtime first**, followed by **floor bonuses**, and lastly **square footage penalties** due to cost efficiency.\n",
    "2. With **2× overtime pay**, **floor bonuses would become preferable over overtime**, making attendants more likely to **exceed floor limits** before relying on overtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of Question (i) **confirm this prediction**:\n",
    "* Total overtime hours decreased, indicating overtime became less attractive\n",
    "* A floor violation occurred, showing the model preferred exceeding floor limits rather than increasing overtime\n",
    "* No square footage violations occurred, confirming this remains the least preferred option\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "This finding reinforces that **higher overtime pay discourages overtime use**, leading the optimization model to **shift towards violating floor constraints instead**. The cost hierarchy outlined in Question D correctly predicted this behavior, demonstrating how regulatory cost structures directly influence optimal scheduling decisions."
